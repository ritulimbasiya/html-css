The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>HTML Links</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a></p>

</body>
</html>

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
The target attribute can have one of the following values:

_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a> 

<p>If target="_blank", the link will open in a new browser window or tab.</p>Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
